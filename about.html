					<p id="firstP" class="lead">Hello, my name is Franklin Gomez Flores.</p>

						<p class="lead">&emsp; My family and I are originally from Guatemala. When I was five, my family immigrated to the United States due to Guatemala’s violence,
						poverty, and lack of opportunities. In 1999, we arrived in Siler City and have called Chatham County our home ever since. As a young boy,
						I quickly realized that my family was in a new country with a different language and a different set of systems. I learned English fast in 
						order to facilitate our transition into the United States. I was born in Guatemala, but raised in Siler City. And yes! I am a naturalized U.S. citizen!</p>
			
						<p class="lead">&emsp; I went through the Chatham County School system, and graduated from Jordan-Matthews High School in 2012 within the top 10 of my class.
						I was a player for Los Jets varsity soccer and a track runner all four years. I was mentored under the Scholars’ Latino Initiative, a program that gave me 
						the tools to become the first person in my family to go to college. </p>
						
						<p class="lead">&emsp; In  2016, I graduated from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I earned my degree in Biology. I was specifically 
						interested in human and plant biology courses. These courses provided me with the foundation to be eco-conscious, to understand that our bodies depend
						on our natural resources for survival, and that we must care for our environment! During and after my time at UNC, I dedicated my time as a volunteer 
						and as an administrator to the very programs that helped me become the person I am now.</p>
						
						<p class="lead">&emsp; I have seen the transformation that the county has gone through and the struggles it had to endure in order to reach this point.
						These events and the negative stereotypes used against the Latinx community ignited my desire to become a constructive citizen for our community, which 
						is the reason why I accepted the opportunity to be a member of the Chatham County Planning Board. The experience as a planning board member has provided
						me with the understanding that Chatham County needs responsible and collaborative leadership. </p>
						
						<p class="lead">&emsp; After years of being a community member and an advocate, I have made the decision to run for County commissioner in order to provide 
						a voice for the unheard. Siler City has not had a voice on the board of commissioners for about 20 years, and I want to change that!  I am a first 
						generation immigrant, first generation college graduate, an aspiring first generation elected official, and I am up for the challenge to serve Chatham 
						County as Commissioner from District 5!</p>
